A decision tree is a predictive modeling tool that recursively partitions data into subsets based on the values of input features. It starts with the entire dataset and selects features that best split the data into homogenous subsets (e.g., based on entropy or Gini impurity). This process continues recursively, creating a tree structure where each internal node represents a feature and each leaf node represents a predicted outcome or class. Decision trees are interpretable and can handle numerical and categorical data. However, they are prone to overfitting, which can be mitigated using techniques like pruning or ensemble methods like random forests.
